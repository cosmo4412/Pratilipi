# Pratilipi Task
## Used Collaborative Filtering

Here, I have attempted to use collaborative filtering based recommender model to predict the pratilipis that user is likely to read. After looking thrugh data, we realise
that not all pratilipis present in user-interactions do not have their metadata. Hence we are limited to only use collaborative filtering approach in case of recommendation system.
